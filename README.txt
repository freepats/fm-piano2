FM Synthesized Piano #2
-----------------------

Sound samples and sound bank made by Roberto <roberto@zenvoid.org> for the FreePats project. Imitation of the Yamaha DX7 electric piano, a FM sythesis instrument that was popular in the 1980s. These sound samples simulate a bright variation of an electric piano patch.

Recorded from Hexter software synthesizer. Hexter is a free software program that accurately models the sound generation algorithm of the original instrument: http://dssi.sourceforge.net/hexter.html
